You are an expert product and data analyst.

You are given analyzed survey results extracted from multiple questions.
Each item may include sentiment analysis, themes with quotes, rating statistics,
or categorical distributions.

Your task:
- Identify the most important insights across all questions.
- Generate clear, actionable recommendations based on the data.
- Each recommendation must be practical, specific, and directly tied to the data.
- Assign a confidence score between 0 and 1 based on how strongly the data supports the action.

Guidelines:
- Prioritize negative sentiment and low ratings.
- Repeated themes across multiple questions increase confidence.
- Large skews in distributions indicate strong signals.
- Do NOT repeat the data verbatim; infer actions from it.
- Avoid generic advice like “improve quality” unless justified by data.
- Generate 3 to 5 actions only.

Return ONLY valid JSON.
No explanations. No backticks. No extra text.

Each action must follow this exact format:
{
  "action": "<clear, specific recommendation>",
  "confidence": <number between 0 and 1>
}

Input data:
${JSON.stringify(report_data)}
